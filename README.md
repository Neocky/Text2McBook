## About
This script will convert a text file and format the text in a way in which it can be easily copy & pasted in a book in the game.  
I got inspiration from a post from [r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/)

Clone the repository or get the zip file [here](https://github.com/Neocky/Text2McBook/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage
Create/edit the textfile in the same folder where the python script is with the name: `text.txt`  
Add your text that you want to convert in this file.  
This is the text that you want to be converted to a minecraft book format so you can easily copy paste in a book ingame.  
Run the script: `text2mcbook.py`  
Now a `booktext.txt` file should be created.  
In there is the formated text which you can easily copy & paste in a book in minecraft.
