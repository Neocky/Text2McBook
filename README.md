## Usage
- Create/edit the textfile in the same folder where the python script is with the name: `text.txt`  
- Add your text that you want to convert in this file.  
- This is the text that you want to be converted to a minecraft book format so you can easily copy paste in a book ingame.  
- Run the script: `text2mcbook.py`  
- Now a `book_text_snbt.txt` and `book_text_give.txt` file should be created.  
#### Method 1:
- Download [IBE Editor](https://modrinth.com/mod/ibe-editor)
- Paste content from `book_text_snbt.txt` to SNBT editor of writable book
#### Method 2:
- Copy command from `book_text_give.txt.`, execute it in minecraft command block

I recommend you to use Method 1 on servers where you can't use command blocks but have creative mode.
