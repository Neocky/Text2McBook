## About

This script will convert text from a textfile to a formatted minecraft book file. The file contains a native `/give` command which can be used ingame to get a `writable_book` with the text as content.  
It supports different book formats which can be choosen with the parameter [`-f FORMATNAME`](https://github.com/Neocky/Text2McBook#parmaters).  
I got inspiration from a post from [r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/).

### Default

The `default` format will create a `/give` command which can be easily copied into a command block ingame to get the writable book.
It will also format the text in a way in which it can be easily copy and pasted in a book in the game. 

### Denizen

[Denizen](https://denizenscript.com/) is a scripting plugin for minecraft servers.  
The `denizen` format will format the text for the `text` property in [Book Script Containers](https://meta.denizenscript.com/Docs/Search/book#book%20script%20containers). It will replace new line symbols with `<n>` and indents the line with 4 spaces to make it easily pasteable in the `text` properties of `book script containers`.  

## Installation

## Usage

Create/edit the textfile in the same folder where the python script is with the name: `text.txt` and add your book text in there.  
This is the text that you want to be converted to a minecraft book format.  
Run the script: `text2mcbook.py`.  
Now a `booktext.txt` file should be created.  
In there is a `/give` command which can be inputted into a command block to get the book. There is also the formated text which you can easily copy & paste in a book in minecraft.
